# Online-shoppers-intention
The project is to explore and create a machine models predicting the purchase of an online shoppers.
The dataset provided for this project has 12330 rows and 18 column and the missing values there are null. I explored each columns of the dataset(UNI-VARIATES), a column to another(BI-VARIATES) and also multiple columns(MULTI-VARIATES) to understand the data before proceeding on modelling. 
4 different models were used in testing the accuracy and to determine the model to be deployed for production. RandomForest gave 89% accuracy, followed by LogisticRegression and Naive bayes which both have 87.5%. The least in Accuracy of the models used was svc which has 83% accuracy.
We can say the models behaved perfectly well but the most accurate is adviced to be deployed for production
